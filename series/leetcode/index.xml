      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 2000 Question Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.&#xA;For example, if word = &amp;quot;abcdefd&amp;quot; and ch = &amp;quot;d&amp;quot;, then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1137 Question The Tribonacci sequence T(n) is defined as follows:&#xA;T(0) = 0, T(1) = 1, T(2) = 1, and T(n+3) = T(n) + T(n+1) + T(n+2) for n &amp;gt;= 0.&#xA;Given n, return the value of T(n).&#xA;Note to self This is a straight forward Recursion Problem. We can convert this to DP by using memoization. We will use an array to store the intermediate values to prevent repeated calculations.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 752 Question You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: &#39;0&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;9&#39;. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn &#39;9&#39; to be &#39;0&#39;, or &#39;0&#39; to be &#39;9&#39;. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.&#xA;The lock initially starts at &#39;0000&#39;, a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1971 Question There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n-1 (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1992 Question You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix land where a 0 represents a hectare of forested land and a 1 represents a hectare of farmland.&#xA;To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.</description>

      <title>Problem Number of Islands</title>
      <link>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/problem-number-of-islands/</link>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 200 Question Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of &#39;1&#39;s (land) and &#39;0&#39;s (water), return the number of islands.&#xA;An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.&#xA;Note to self They use characters not integers for 1 and 0.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 463 Question You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.&#xA;Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).&#xA;The island doesn&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;lakes&amp;rdquo;, meaning the water inside isn&amp;rsquo;t connected to the water around the island.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 988 Question You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters &#39;a&#39; to &#39;z&#39;.&#xA;Return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.&#xA;As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.&#xA;For example, &amp;quot;ab&amp;quot; is lexicographically smaller than &amp;quot;aba&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 623 Question Given the root of a binary tree and two integers val and depth, add a row of nodes with value val at the given depth depth.&#xA;Note that the root node is at depth 1.&#xA;The adding rule is:&#xA;Given the integer depth, for each not null tree node cur at the depth depth - 1, create two tree nodes with value val as cur&#39;s left subtree root and right subtree root.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 129 Question You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.&#xA;Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.&#xA;For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -&amp;gt; 2 -&amp;gt; 3 represents the number 123. Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.&#xA;A leaf node is a node with no children.</description>
