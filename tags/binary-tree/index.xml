      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 979 Question You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.&#xA;In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.&#xA;Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1325 Question Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.&#xA;Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).&#xA;Example 1 Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2 Output: [1,null,3,null,4] Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 2331 Question You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:&#xA;Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True. Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND. The evaluation of a node is as follows:&#xA;If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 988 Question You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters &#39;a&#39; to &#39;z&#39;.&#xA;Return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.&#xA;As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.&#xA;For example, &amp;quot;ab&amp;quot; is lexicographically smaller than &amp;quot;aba&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 623 Question Given the root of a binary tree and two integers val and depth, add a row of nodes with value val at the given depth depth.&#xA;Note that the root node is at depth 1.&#xA;The adding rule is:&#xA;Given the integer depth, for each not null tree node cur at the depth depth - 1, create two tree nodes with value val as cur&#39;s left subtree root and right subtree root.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 129 Question You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.&#xA;Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.&#xA;For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -&amp;gt; 2 -&amp;gt; 3 represents the number 123. Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.&#xA;A leaf node is a node with no children.</description>
