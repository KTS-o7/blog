      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1636 Question Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.&#xA;Return the sorted array.&#xA;Example 1 Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3] Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2] Explanation: &amp;#39;3&amp;#39; has a frequency of 1, &amp;#39;1&amp;#39; has a frequency of 2, and &amp;#39;2&amp;#39; has a frequency of 3. Example 2 Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2] Output: [1,3,3,2,2] Explanation: &amp;#39;2&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;3&amp;#39; both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 786 Question You are given a sorted integer array arr containing 1 and prime numbers, where all the integers of arr are unique. You are also given an integer k.&#xA;For every i and j where 0 &amp;lt;= i &amp;lt; j &amp;lt; arr.length, we consider the fraction arr[i] / arr[j].&#xA;Return the kth smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size 2, where answer[0] == arr[i] and answer[1] == arr[j].</description>
