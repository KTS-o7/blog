      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1110 Question Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.&#xA;After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).&#xA;Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.&#xA;Example 1 Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5] Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]] Example 2 Input: root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3] Output: [[1,2,4]] Constraints - The number of nodes in the given tree is at most `1000`.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 2058 Question A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima.&#xA;A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.&#xA;A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.</description>

      <title>Problem 2181 Merge Nodes in Between Zeros</title>
      <link>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/prev_solns/problem-merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/</link>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 2181 Question You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0&amp;rsquo;s. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.&#xA;For every two consecutive 0&amp;rsquo;s, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <title>Problem 2816 Double a Number Represented as a Linked List</title>
      <link>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/prev_solns/problem-double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list/</link>

      <guid>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/prev_solns/problem-double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list/</guid>
      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 2816 Question You are given the head of a non-empty linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.&#xA;Return the head of the linked list after doubling it&#xA;Example 1 Input graph LR A((1))--&gt;B((8)) B--&gt;C((9)) Output graph LR A((3))--&gt;B((7)) B--&gt;C((8)) Input: head = [1,8,9] Output: [3,7,8] Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.</description>

      <title>Problem 2487 Remove Nodes From Linked List</title>
      <link>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/prev_solns/problem-remove-nodes-from-linked-list/</link>

      <guid>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/prev_solns/problem-remove-nodes-from-linked-list/</guid>
      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 2487 Question You are given the head of a linked list.&#xA;Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.&#xA;Return the head of the modified linked list.&#xA;Example 1 Input graph LR A((5))--&gt;B((2)) B--&gt;C((13)) C--&gt;D((3)) D--&gt;E((8)) Output graph LR A((13))--&gt;B((8)) Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8] Output: [13,8] Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>Problem 237 Delete Node in a Linked List</title>
      <link>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/prev_solns/problem-delete-node-in-a-linked-list/</link>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 237 Question There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.&#xA;You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.&#xA;All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.</description>
