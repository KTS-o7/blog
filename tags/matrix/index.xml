      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1219 Question In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.&#xA;Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:&#xA;Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell. From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 861 Question You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.&#xA;A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all 0&amp;rsquo;s to 1&amp;rsquo;s, and all 1&amp;rsquo;s to 0&amp;rsquo;s).&#xA;Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.&#xA;Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves (including zero moves).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 2373 Question You are given an n x n integer matrix grid.&#xA;Generate an integer matrix maxLocal of size (n - 2) x (n - 2) such that:&#xA;maxLocal[i][j] is equal to the largest value of the 3 x 3 matrix in grid centered around row i + 1 and column j + 1. In other words, we want to find the largest value in every contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link: Problem Minimum Falling Path Sum II Question Given an n x n integer matrix grid, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.&#xA;A falling path with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of grid such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.&#xA;Example 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] Output: 13 Explanation: The possible falling paths are: [1,5,9], [1,5,7], [1,6,7], [1,6,8], [2,4,8], [2,4,9], [2,6,7], [2,6,8], [3,4,8], [3,4,9], [3,5,7], [3,5,9] The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,5,7], so the answer is 13.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1992 Question You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix land where a 0 represents a hectare of forested land and a 1 represents a hectare of farmland.&#xA;To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 200 Question Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of &#39;1&#39;s (land) and &#39;0&#39;s (water), return the number of islands.&#xA;An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.&#xA;Note to self They use characters not integers for 1 and 0.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 463 Question You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.&#xA;Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).&#xA;The island doesn&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;lakes&amp;rdquo;, meaning the water inside isn&amp;rsquo;t connected to the water around the island.</description>
