      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1598 Question The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.&#xA;The operations are described below:&#xA;&amp;quot;../&amp;quot; : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder). &amp;quot;./&amp;quot; : Remain in the same folder. &amp;quot;x/&amp;quot; : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1823 Question There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 &amp;lt;= i &amp;lt; n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.&#xA;The rules of the game are as follows:</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1518 Question There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange bumExchange empty water bottles for one full water bottle. The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.&#xA;Given two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.&#xA;Example 1 Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3 Output: 13 Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 2582 Question There are n people standing in a line labeled from 1 to n. The first person in the line is holding a pillow initially. Every second, the person holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. Once the pillow reaches the end of the line, the direction changes, and people continue passing the pillow in the opposite direction.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 633 Question Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there are two integers a and b such that a^2 + b^2 = c.&#xA;Note Even thought it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say in the question , the numbers can be equal, ie a=b is valid. since we are talking about square sums, it is safe to say that values of any one of variable can be atmost sqrt(c) Example 1 Input: c = 5 Output: true Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5 Example 2 Input: c = 3 Output: false Constraints 0 &amp;lt;= c &amp;lt;= 2^31 - 1 Solution class Solution { public: bool judgeSquareSum(int c) { long long int l =0,r = sqrt(c); long long int sum; while(l&amp;lt;=r) { sum = l*l + r*r; if(sum == c) return true; else if(sum&amp;gt;c) r--; else l++; } return false; } }; Complexity Analysis Time Complexity : O(sqrt(n)) Space Complexity : O(1) Explanation 1.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 786 Question You are given a sorted integer array arr containing 1 and prime numbers, where all the integers of arr are unique. You are also given an integer k.&#xA;For every i and j where 0 &amp;lt;= i &amp;lt; j &amp;lt; arr.length, we consider the fraction arr[i] / arr[j].&#xA;Return the kth smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size 2, where answer[0] == arr[i] and answer[1] == arr[j].</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1137 Question The Tribonacci sequence T(n) is defined as follows:&#xA;T(0) = 0, T(1) = 1, T(2) = 1, and T(n+3) = T(n) + T(n+1) + T(n+2) for n &amp;gt;= 0.&#xA;Given n, return the value of T(n).&#xA;Note to self This is a straight forward Recursion Problem. We can convert this to DP by using memoization. We will use an array to store the intermediate values to prevent repeated calculations.</description>
