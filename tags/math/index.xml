      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 3264 Question You are given an integer array nums, an integer k, and an integer multiplier.&#xA;You need to perform k operations on nums. In each operation:&#xA;Find the minimum value x in nums. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears first. Replace the selected minimum value x with x * multiplier. Return an integer array denoting the final state of nums after performing all k operations.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 264 Question An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.&#xA;Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.&#xA;Example 1 Input: n = 10 Output: 12 Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers. Example 2 Input: n = 1 Output: 1 Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1137 Question The Tribonacci sequence T(n) is defined as follows:&#xA;T(0) = 0, T(1) = 1, T(2) = 1, and T(n+3) = T(n) + T(n+1) + T(n+2) for n &amp;gt;= 0.&#xA;Given n, return the value of T(n).&#xA;Note to self This is a straight forward Recursion Problem. We can convert this to DP by using memoization. We will use an array to store the intermediate values to prevent repeated calculations.</description>
