      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 832 Question Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.&#xA;To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.&#xA;For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1]. To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.&#xA;For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 523 Question Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if nums has a good subarray or false otherwise.&#xA;A good subarray is a subarray where:&#xA;its length is at least two, and the sum of the elements of the subarray is a multiple of k.&#xA;Note A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. An integer x is a multiple of k if there exists an integer n such that x = n * k.</description>
