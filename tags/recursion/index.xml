      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1038 Question Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.&#xA;As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:&#xA;The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node&amp;rsquo;s key.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 131 Question Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.&#xA;Note to self First we need to split the string into all possible substrings. Then we need to check if each substring is a palindrome or not. If that split is palindromic then we need to add it to the result.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 78 Question Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).&#xA;A subset of an array is a selection of elements (possibly none) of the array. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.&#xA;Example 1 Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]] Example 2 Input: nums = [0] Output: [[],[0]] Constraints 1 &amp;lt;= nums.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1863 Question The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.&#xA;For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1. Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.&#xA;Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.</description>

      <title>Problem Distribute Coins in Binary Tree</title>

      <guid>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/problem-distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/</guid>
      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 979 Question You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.&#xA;In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.&#xA;Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.</description>

      <title>Problem Delete Leaves With a Given Value</title>
      <link>https://KTS-o7.github.io/blog/posts/problem-delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/</link>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1325 Question Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.&#xA;Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).&#xA;Example 1 Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2 Output: [1,null,3,null,4] Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left).</description>
