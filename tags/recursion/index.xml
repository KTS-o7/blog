      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1325 Question Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.&#xA;Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).&#xA;Example 1 Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2 Output: [1,null,3,null,4] Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left).</description>
