      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 590 Question Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes&amp;rsquo; values.&#xA;Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)&#xA;Example 1 Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6] Output: [5,6,3,2,4,1] Example 2 Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14] Output: [2,6,14,11,7,3,12,8,4,13,9,10,5,1] Constraints - `The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 979 Question You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.&#xA;In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.&#xA;Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Link - Problem 1325 Question Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.&#xA;Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).&#xA;Example 1 Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2 Output: [1,null,3,null,4] Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left).</description>
